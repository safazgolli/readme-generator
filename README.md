# readme-generatorAS A developer

## Discription:

I WANT a README generator SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project.
A command-line application that accepts user input.
If I am prompted for information about my application repository, a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.
If I enter my project title, this is displayed as the title of the README.
If I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instruction, this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests.
If I choose a license for my application from a list of options a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under.
If I enter my GitHub username this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile.
If I enter my email address, this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions.
If I click on the links in the Table of Contents, I am taken to the corresponding section of the README.
